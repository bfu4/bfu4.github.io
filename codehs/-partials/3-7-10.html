            <p>Because of some obscure features of the Java compiler, this assignment will work just fine even if you use <code>==</code> instead <code>.equals()</code>. You can just change nothing for this one! Even so, you should still use the code below. That trick will fail on more complex assignments, where it isn't as easy for the compiler to optimize.</p>
