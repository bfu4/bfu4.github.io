<h2><a></a>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</h2>
<p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and<br>
    conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share<br>
    original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright<br>
    and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The<br>
    following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not<br>
    exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are<br>
        intended for use by those authorized to give the public<br>
        permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by<br>
        copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are<br>
        irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms<br>
        and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.<br>
        Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before<br>
        applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the<br>
        material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any<br>
        material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-<br>
        licensed material, or material used under an exception or<br>
        limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:<br>
        <a>wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors</a></li>
    <li>Considerations for the public: By using one of our public<br>
        licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the<br>
        licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If<br>
        the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for<br>
        example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to<br>
        copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our<br>
        licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain<br>
        other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of<br>
        the licensed material may still be restricted for other<br>
        reasons, including because others have copyright or other<br>
        rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,<br>
        such as asking that all changes be marked or described.<br>
        Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to<br>
        respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations<br>

            <li>
                <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,<br>
                    the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,<br>
                    non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to<br>
                    exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:</p>
                <p>a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or<br>
                    in part; and</p>
                <p>b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where<br>
                    Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public<br>
                    License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with<br>
                    its terms and conditions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section<br>
                    6(a).</p>
            </li>

                <p>Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The<br>
                    Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in<br>
                    all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,<br>
                    and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The<br>
                    Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or<br>
                    authority to forbid You from making technical modifications<br>
                    necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including<br>
                    technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective<br>
                    Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,<br>
                    simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)<br>
                    (4) never produces Adapted Material.</p>

                    Public License.</p>
                <p>b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose<br>
                    any additional or different terms or conditions on, or<br>
                    apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the<br>
                    Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the<br>
                    Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed<br>

                    the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to<br>
                    assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited<br>
                    extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed<br>
                    Rights, but not otherwise.</p>

                    Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society<br>
                    under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory<br>
                    licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly<br>

            Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE<br>
            EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS<br>
            AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF<br>
            ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,<br>

            KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT<br>
            ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE<br>
            TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>
            NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,<br>
            INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,<br>
            COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR<br>
            USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN<br>
            ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR<br>
            DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR<br>
            IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided<br>
            above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent<br>
            possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and<br>
            waiver of all liability.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3><a></a>Section 6 – Term and Termination.</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and<br>
            Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with<br>
            this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License<br>
            terminate automatically.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under<br>
            Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided<br>
                    it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the<br>
                    violation; or</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any<br>
            right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations<br>
            of this Public License.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br>
            Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop<br>
            distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so<br>
            will not terminate this Public License.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public<br>
            License.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3><a></a>Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different<br>
            terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

            Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and<br>
            independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3><a></a>Section 8 – Interpretation.</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and<br>
            shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose<br>
            conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully<br>
            be made without permission under this Public License.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is<br>
            deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the<br>
            minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision<br>
            cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License<br>
            without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and<br>
            conditions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no<br>
            failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the<br>
            Licensor.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted<br>
            as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities<br>
            that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal<br>
            processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</p>
