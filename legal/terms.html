            through the Service.</p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable

            party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <h1>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h1>
        <p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects
            without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own
            behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers,
            expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
            Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
            non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or
            trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and
            makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended
            results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without

        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
            statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You.
            But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest

        <h2>Waiver</h2>
        <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under
